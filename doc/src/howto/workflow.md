The workflow is :

- [instanciate the graph](./instanciate_graph.md)
- [use exiting rules](./use_existing_rules.md)
- [add the nodes](./add_nodes.md)
- [add the egdes](./add_edges.md)
- for debugging purposes, [plot the build graph](./plot_graph.md)
- [call the make function](./make.md)

In the following pages, we illustrate the usage with the build of program written in C. We will use rules that already exists,
to add your own rules to to section [add your own rules](./addrules.md)
