# use existing rules

You need to have exiting rules to construct a graph. In this example, we use existing rules for building a program written in C, and using the gcc suite.

see [this section](./addrules.md) for adding your own build rules.

```rust
{{#include ../../../examples/c_project.rs:use_existing_rules}}
```
