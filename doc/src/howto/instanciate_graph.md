# instanciate the graph
the code examples are taken from `C_demo_project.rs`.

first instanciate a instance of M::G
( cli is the command line arguments, here we pass srcdir and sandbox )

```rust
{{#include ../../../yamake/examples/C_demo_project.rs:use}}
```


```rust
{{#include ../../../yamake/examples/C_demo_project.rs:instanciate}}
```
