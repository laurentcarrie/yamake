# instanciate the graph
the code examples are taken from `examples/c_project_demo`.

first instanciate a instance of M::G
( cli is the command line arguments, here we pass srcdir and sandbox )

```rust
{{#include ../../../yamake/examples/c_project_demo/main.rs:use}}
```


```rust
{{#include ../../../yamake/examples/c_project_demo/main.rs:instanciate}}
```
