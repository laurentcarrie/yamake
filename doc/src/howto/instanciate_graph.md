# instanciate the graph
the code examples are taken from `examples/c_project.rs`.

first instanciate a instance of M::G
( cli is the command line arguments, here we pass srcdir and sandbox )

```rust
{{#include ../../../examples/c_project.rs:use}}
```


```rust
{{#include ../../../examples/c_project.rs:instanciate}}
```
